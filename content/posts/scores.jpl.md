Analysis made on request. Wanted to explorer scores in the Belgian League. Was quite interesting how much interesting things you can do with a modicum of data. I just focused on the raw scores without linking them to teams or anything and already several, more or less interesting, questions came up naturally.

Code [here](https://github.com/IsaacVerm/scoresJpl), [analysis](https://rpubs.com/isaacverm/scoresJpl) itself hosted on RPubs.
