Made a [post about possible rank changes for teams in the Jupiler Pro League](https://rpubs.com/isaacverm/possible-rank-changes). Felt inspired to try to replicate [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/a9n0rv/this_season_ive_been_creating_these_possible/) on r/dataisbeautiful. Integrating `rmarkdown` with Hugo didn't seem straightforward so I decided to publish it to RPubs and link to it from here.

[Code for this post](https://github.com/IsaacVerm/possibleRankChanges) can be found on GitHub . Used the package structure again as in the reproducible analysis series and found it very enjoyable. Using the `devtools` CLI really makes your life easier.
