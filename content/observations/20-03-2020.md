Под небом голубым есть город золотой,
С прозрачными воротами и яркою звездой.
А в городе том сад, все травы да цветы;
Гуляют там животные невиданной красы.

> Call it imposter syndrome, a Jonah complex or a simple lack of self-esteem – perhaps any attempt at interpretation is an exercise in cod psychology – but at the very least, that episode offers us a window on how Torres saw himself when at the absolute peak of his powers. Even then, as a fresh-faced, befreckled goal-scoring phenomenon, he felt unworthy of the acclaim which his performances attracted.

Baron Roman (Robert) Fyodorovich [von Ungern-Sternberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_von_Ungern-Sternberg) often referred to as Baron Ungern, was an anti-communist general in the Russian Civil War and thereafter an independent warlord who intervened in Mongolia against China. One of the Russian Empire's Baltic German minority, Ungern was an arch-conservative monarchist who aspired to restore the Russian monarchy after the revolutions of 1917 and to revive the Mongol Empire under the rule of the Bogd Khan. His attraction to Vajrayana Buddhism and his eccentric, often violent treatment of enemies and his own men earned him the sobriquet "the Mad Baron" or "the Bloody Baron".
