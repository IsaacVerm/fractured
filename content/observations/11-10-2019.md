Доверяй, но проверяй (words are the wise man's counters and the fool's money)

вера = trust

До and про refer to completion, so almost no difference between to check and to trust.

Once you free your mind about a concept\
Of harmony and of music being correct\
You can do whatever you want\
So, nobody told me what to do\
And there was no preconception of what to do\

King Edward III, whose reign began in 1327, when he was 14, led England through a series of military victories. But toward the end of his life, his court had become so riddled with corruption that the parliament of 1376, which tried to address the problems, became known as the Good Parliament. It was responsible for the first impeachment in English history (of William Latimer).

In 1377 he became governor of Calais, and took part against the Spaniards at the [battle of Sluys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sluys).
