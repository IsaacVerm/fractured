Carlos Henrique Raposo (born 2 April 1963), commonly known as [Carlos Kaiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Kaiser_(footballer)), is a Brazilian former footballer who played as a striker, better known as being a "farce footballer". He was selected to play with many teams in his decade-long career, but never actually played a regulation game and hid his limited ability with injuries, frequent team changes and other ruses.

In 1986, he moved to Europe and joined French Division 2 club Gazélec Ajaccio where a friend was playing. At his presentation, the club arranged a training session with the fans and, afraid of being caught, he shot all the balls to the crowd while kissing the club's badge.

> In much the same way that a previous generation of Americans countenanced legalized segregation, ours has countenanced legalized torture. And there is no clearer manifestation of this than our routine use of solitary confinement—on our own people, in our own communities, in a supermax prison, for example, that is a thirty-minute drive from my door.
