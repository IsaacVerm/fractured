[This decision](https://pudding.cool/2019/04/eu-regions/) was made to increase the amount of funding received from the European Union, which dedicates a third of its budget (50 billion euros) to less economically developed regions for investments in infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals. Yet when regions improve economically, they no longer qualify for the same amount of funding. As a type of statistical gerrymandering, governors of these regions—like in Hungary—have redrawn their borders in order to keep the money flowing.

Tear me apart and boil my bones\
I'll not rest till she's lost her throne\
My aim is true my message is clear\
It's curtains for you, Elizabeth my dear\
