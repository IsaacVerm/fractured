All of the sudden I felt like someone punched me in the stomach with a baseball bat. I got the wind knocked out of me and stumbled backwards. When I looked up there was a 40 oz. bottle at my feet. It had hit me in the gut/dick.

The perpetrator was a 300 lb. black sister who was standing right below me at my monitor. I looked her right in the eye and she waved me forward, as if she was going to tell me a secret. I leaned in and she said “baby, you gots to go.” She then stuck two thumbs down in my face to reinforce the point. And then to make sure I heard her she said again, “[MOTHERFUCKER YOU GOTS TO GO.](https://www.jambase.com/article/road-story-the-night-ween-met-busta-rhymes)”
