‘[Automating](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1319:_Automation)’ comes from the roots ‘auto-‘ meaning ‘self-‘, and ‘mating’, meaning ‘screwing’.

Test automation must be the absolute superlative then.

[Cars](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/pi-synthesisers/) was recorded using only four synth tracks and a real live drummer.

[Businessman Tan Youhui](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-50137450)
hired a hitman to take out his competitor for 282,000 dollars, a court heard.

But the hitman hired another man to do the job, offering 141,000 dollars. That man hired another hitman, who hired another hitman, who hired another hitman.

The plan crumbled when the final hitman met the man, named only as Wei, in a cafe and proposed faking his death.

_In der Beschränkung zeigt sich erst der Meister._

Apparently originally from [Goethe](https://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/sonette-3649/1), never knew.
