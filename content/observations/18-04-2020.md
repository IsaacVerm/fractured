[Metropolitan diary](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/nyregion/metropolitan-diary.html) always has good stories.

> I was at home one afternoon when a man rang the intercom and asked whether I could buzz him into the building. He said that his turtle had fallen out the window and into the alley between his building and mine, and that he wanted to get to the alley from my building’s basement.

> I paused. No one could make this up, I decided.

> “I love turtles,” I said, buzzing him in. “I hope he’s OK.”

> About five minutes later, I looked out the window and saw a tall man come out my building’s front door. He was holding a good-size turtle that was moving its arms and legs.

> It was OK, I guess, just shook up.
