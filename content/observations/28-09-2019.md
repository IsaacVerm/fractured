Another chess analysis but this time I annotated a bit different than I did for the one of [24-09-2019](https://isaacverm.github.io/observations/24-09-2019/):

- less focus on strategy
- only using local analysis
- tags

Blunders made are still quite big. These have to be purged first before making sound strategic decisions pay off.

By default Lichess annotates your game with automated comments like blunder, mistake,... I found those quite annoying but since there's no option to turn them off somehow forcing you to manually remove them one by one, for the time being I choose to only use local analysis. It's less powerful than the server-side analysis but since I still play quite badly at the moment that's no issue :).

Also I started using tags. At the moment the following have been defined:

- [strategy]
- [question]
- [blunder]

Tags will make it easier to see exactly where my play goes wrong once I've got more games analyzed. E.g. searching for the [blunder] tag to get an overview of the type of blunders I make most then is trivial.

+++++

Generalities out of the way, I annotated this game:

Correctly spotted a bishop fork in the beginning netting me a piece. However, made 2 massive blunders shortly after one another making me lose the game. *16 ... Ne5*: made my own queen overworked. My opponent didn't notice but directly after *17 ... Be6* leaving the knight on e5 almost hanging (after the combination) signed my death warrant.

A move also marked as blunder by Stockfish was *13 ... Bg4*.  No idea why because when going through the optimal variation I seem to end up in quite a bad situation (exposed king, double pawn).

About as dry as you expect a German industrial musician to be.
