[The tunnel is all that there is, and I’m having to find my way in the dark](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/terminal-cancer-lockdown-death).

> Others feel time is standing still right now, but for me it is slipping through my fingers.

[Often with those things, you’re waiting for someone else to grant you some kind of permission to do it.](https://www.huckmag.com/art-and-culture/music-2/cate-le-bon-interview-reward-daylight-matters/)

> You realise a lot of things; you dissect a lot of things when you spend an extended period by yourself. Self-pity can be quite delicious when you’re by yourself. You can allow yourself that self-pity because you’re not really burdening anybody else with it.

He’s 51 now and never thinks of retiring because, he said, “[I’m kind of retired now](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-05-11-ca-1497-story.html). You have to remember I didn’t do anything for the last five years.

> It’s a quiet life and it had its advantages. There’s no responsibility: You don’t have anything to clean up, it’s cheap, the bills are a cash deal. I’d bicycle most places, which I found could be faster than a car. I didn’t own a phone. As far as business goes it was kind of slim because if you don’t communicate you don’t do too much business nowadays.

[Cornell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Cornell#Depression_and_substance_abuse).

> No one really knows what run-of-the-mill depression is. You'll think somebody has run-of-the-mill depression, and then the next thing you know, they're hanging from a rope. It's hard to tell the difference. But I do feel that depression can be useful. Sometimes it's just chemical. It doesn't seem to come from anywhere. And whenever I've been in any kind of depression, I've over the years tried to not only imagine what it feels like to not be there, but try to remind myself that I could just wake up the next day and it could be gone because that happens, and not to worry about it. And at the same time, when I'm feeling great, I remember the depression and think about the differences in what I'm feeling and why I would feel that way, and not be reactionary one way or the other. You just have to realize that these are patterns of life and you just go through them.
