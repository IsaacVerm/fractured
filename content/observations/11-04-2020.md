> It was all those people in the cars coming the other way, she says. The
first one looked so sad. And then the next one looked exactly the same way,

The word **trespassing** is closely connected technology.

From *Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance*:

> You go through a heavy industrial area
of a large city and there it all is, the technology. In front of it are high
barbed-wire fences, locked gates, signs saying NO TRESPASSING, and
beyond, through sooty air, you see ugly strange shapes of metal and brick
whose purpose is unknown, and whose masters you will never see.
