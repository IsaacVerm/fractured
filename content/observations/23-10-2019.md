At any given moment, all sorts of objects are drifting in the ocean, a surprising number of them Americans. The Coast Guard plucks 10 people a day out of the ocean, on average.

[Postman to Paris](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/thomas-meunier-belgium-postman-to-paris).

We stopped talking about football. That was a problem, because football was our life.

On the pitch, strange things started to happen for me. I was playing as a striker, and I began scoring these incredible goals. Left foot, right foot, headers; from 10 meters, from 50 meters. It was crazy. And I didn’t even realise it, but people were filming my goals and putting them on YouTube. I guess some of them went viral on social media, and soon everyone in Belgium was talking about this guy in the Third Division scoring these crazy goals.

They probably didn’t realise he worked at a car factory.

It’s funny to explain, but do you know why I scored those goals? Because I really felt like I was free. I was no longer playing out of obligation. I had escaped the “talent factory” at Standard Liège. There was no longer anyone on the sidelines telling me, “You have to do this, otherwise you won’t succeed.”

If the universe is so bad, or even
half so bad, how on earth did human beings ever come to attribute it to the activity of a wise and good Creator? Men are fools,
perhaps; but hardly so foolish as that. The direct inference from
black to white, from evil flower to virtuous root, from senseless
work to a workman infinitely wise, staggers belief.
